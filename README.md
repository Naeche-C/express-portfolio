This project is my personal portfolio website built using Node.js, ExpressJS, and EJS. It includes four main pages (Home, About, Projects, and Contact) and uses Bootstrap and Font Awesome for responsive design and styling. I created reusable header and footer partials and stored all my images and CSS in the public folder. The project demonstrates my understanding of Express routing, template rendering, and web hosting. My portfolio is deployed live on Render and linked to my GitHub repository for version control.
